# Melanoma Classification
### Introduction
"Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75%
of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society
estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It’s also expected that
almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective." -- [Kaggle SIIM-ISIC challange](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/overview)  

This is a course project in CS324 Deep Learning. The project aims to classify the positive sample from a modified dataset in SIIM-ISIC challange [[Project Description]](/Instruction_v2.pdf).
